Many blood tests for diabetes involve either fasting or continuous monitoring, but this test does not.It is useful for people who need a speedy diagnosis, such as those with type 1 diabetes who require urgent supplementary insulin. How To TEst Work? Glucose is a form of sugar. It is the body's primary energy source and fuels every cell â€” including those in the brain, heart, and muscles. Glucose mainly comes from food and drink people consume. The body also breaks down stored forms of the carbohydrate glycogen into glucose.The body works continuously to keep the amount of blood glucose at optimum levels. It produces a hormone called insulin to achieve this, which helps glucose get into the cells that need it for energy.A person with type 1 diabetes does not produce insulin as their body no longer makes insulin.",
